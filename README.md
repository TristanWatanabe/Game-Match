# Game Match

Game Match is a fun take on the popular swiping app tinder where users
are able to swipe right or left on boardgames instead of people.
Each boardgame has a set number of people that can join (i.e. 8)
and once that amount of people have swiped right on the boardgame,
those individuals are inserted into a group chat where they can talk amongst
themselves and plan meetups to play boardgames!
